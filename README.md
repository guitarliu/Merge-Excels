# Merge-Excels
Merge two Excels with same data formats
### As you can see, the (Failure)compare_excel.py script is a piece of shit. The merge_excel.py is better than that. 
### For these scripts, I learn that simple is always the right way. With a simple and clear thought is seriously important.
### For using modules, I learn that use the powerful and newer ones other than complete and older ones.
